# Day 09 – NumPy Basics

NumPy is the core library for numerical computing in Python.  
Today we learn how to create arrays, perform operations, and manipulate data efficiently.

## What I learned
- NumPy arrays vs Python lists
- Array creation and indexing
- Element-wise operations
- Basic aggregation functions (sum, mean, min, max)

## What I practiced
- Creating arrays
- Performing mathematical operations on arrays
- Reshaping and slicing arrays

## Takeaway
NumPy arrays are faster and more efficient than lists, essential for AI/ML pipelines.
