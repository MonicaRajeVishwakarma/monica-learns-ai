# Day 12 — Data Visualization (Matplotlib + Seaborn)

Today’s focus was on **visualizing data** using Python’s two most important plotting libraries:  
**Matplotlib** (low-level, customizable) and **Seaborn** (statistical and elegant).

These are essential tools for any **AI/ML engineer**, because every model begins with understanding the data.
These libraries are used in exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature understanding, anomaly detection, and model diagnostics.

## What You Learned

### 1. Matplotlib — Core Visualization
- Line plots  
- Scatter plots  
- Bar charts  
- Subplots  
- Titles, labels, figure styling  
- Axis rotation and formatting  

### 2. Seaborn — Statistical Visualization
- Distribution plots - `histplot`, `kdeplot`
- Boxplots  
- Heatmaps  
- Pairplots  
- Built-in themes and color palettes  

### 3. Applying Plots to Your Dataset
Using: data/habits.csv

You can explore:
- Sleep trends  
- Mood distribution  
- Numerical feature comparisons  
- Correlations between variables  

## Why This Matters for AI Engineering
Visualization is one of the strongest skills you can develop as an AI engineer:

- Helps understand the dataset before modeling  
- Shows trends, anomalies, and correlations  
- Guides feature engineering  
- Reveals data quality issues early  
- Makes model results explainable  
- Helps communicate insights clearly  

Good visualization = better decisions + better models.

## Exercises Included

- Line plot of sleep hours
- Histogram of steps/mood
- Scatter plot to observe correlations
- Boxplot of numerical features
- Heatmap of correlations
