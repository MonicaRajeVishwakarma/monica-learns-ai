# 1. Create variables
your_name = "Monica"
baby_age_weeks = 14
milk_quantity = 0.12
is_sleeping = True

# 2. Print their types
print(type(your_name))
print(type(baby_age_weeks))
print(type(milk_quantity))
print(type(is_sleeping))

# 3. Arithmetic practice
future_age = baby_age_weeks + 2
print("Baby's age in 2 weeks:", future_age)

print("Double milk quantity:", double_milk)

# 4. String operations
