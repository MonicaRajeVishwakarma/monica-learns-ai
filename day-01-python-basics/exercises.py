# Day 1 Exercises – Python Basics

# 1. Create variables
your_name = "Monica"
your_lastname = "Vishwakarma"
baby_age_weeks = 14
baby_age_months = 4
milk_quantity = 0.12
water_quantity = 0.01
is_sleeping = True
is_rolling = False

# 2. Print their types
print(type(your_name))
print(type(your_lastname))
print(type(baby_age_weeks))
print(type(baby_age_months))
print(type(milk_quantity))
print(type(water_quantity))
print(type(is_sleeping))
print(type(is_rolling))


# 3. Arithmetic practice
future_age_weeks = baby_age_weeks + 2
print("Baby's age in 2 weeks:", future_age_weeks)
future_age_months = baby_age_months + 2
print("Baby's age in 2 months",future_age_months)


double_milk = milk_quantity * 2
print("Double milk quantity:", double_milk)

double_water = water_quantity * 2
print("Double water quantity",double_water)

# 4. String operations
msg = your_name + " " + your_lastname +" is learning AI!"
print(msg)


print("Keep going! " * 3)
print("Keep learning! " * 3)
