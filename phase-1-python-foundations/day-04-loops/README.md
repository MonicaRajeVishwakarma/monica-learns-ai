# Day 4 – Loops and Iteration

Today I continued my AI Engineering journey by learning how Python repeats actions using loops.  
I focused on `for` loops, `while` loops, and how they help automate repetitive tasks.

## ✅ What I learned
- How `for` loops iterate through lists and strings  
- How `while` loops repeat actions until a condition changes  
- The difference between controlled (for) and conditional (while) loops  
- How `break` and `continue` affect loop flow  

## ✅ What I practiced
- Looping through a list of baby items  
- Counting numbers using a while loop  
- Using break to stop early  
- Using continue to skip steps  

## ✅ Takeaway
Loops make code more efficient, a single block can do the work of many lines.  
It feels empowering to see how programs can repeat tasks automatically, just like routines in real life.
