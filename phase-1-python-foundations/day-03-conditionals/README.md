# Day 3 – Conditionals (if, elif, else)

Today I continued my AI Engineering journey by learning how Python makes decisions using conditionals.

## ✅ What I learned
- How `if` checks a condition
- How `elif` adds more options
- How `else` handles everything else
- How programs choose different actions based on logic 

## ✅ What I practiced
- Writing `if`, `elif` and `else` statements  
- Comparing numbers and strings  
- Using conditions to print different messages  
- Combining conditions with `and` / `or`

## ✅ Takeaway
Conditionals make programs react intelligently, just like decision-making in real life.  
Small steps, one concept at a time, build real confidence.
