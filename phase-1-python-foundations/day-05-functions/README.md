# Day 5 – Functions

Today I learned how to create and use functions in Python.  
Functions help organize code, avoid repetition, and keep programs clean.

## ✅ What I learned
- How to define a function using `def`
- How to pass arguments into a function
- How to return values
- The difference between parameters and arguments

## ✅ What I practiced
- Creating simple functions
- Functions with parameters
- Functions that return results

## ✅ Takeaway
Functions make code easier to manage, like reusable building blocks.  
A small but very empowering step in writing real programs.
