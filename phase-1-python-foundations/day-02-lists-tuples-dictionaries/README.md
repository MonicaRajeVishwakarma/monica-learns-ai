# Day 2 – Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Today I continued my AI Engineering journey by learning how Python stores and organizes collections of data.  
I focused on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and using loops to go through them.

## ✅ What I learned
- How to create and update **lists** (changeable collections)  
- How **tuples** store fixed data that can’t be changed  
- How **dictionaries** organize data in key–value pairs  
- How to use **for loops** to process multiple items efficiently in lists and dictionaries 

## ✅ What I practiced
- Adding and accessing elements in a list  
- Creating and reading tuple values  
- Updating and extending a dictionary  
- Looping through lists and dictionaries to print their contents  

## ✅ Takeaway
Learning to organize and loop through data feels like understanding how machines “think.”  
Each concept builds the foundation for handling datasets in AI — one calm, steady step at a time.
