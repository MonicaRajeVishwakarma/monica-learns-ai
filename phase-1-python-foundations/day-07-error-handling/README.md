# Day 7 – Error Handling

Today I learned how Python handles errors (called exceptions) and how to write programs that don’t crash when something goes wrong.  
This is a very important skill for building reliable AI systems.

---

## ✅ What I Learned
- What exceptions are in Python  
- How to use `try` and `except`  
- Catching specific types of errors  
- Handling multiple exceptions  
- Using `else` and `finally` blocks  
- Raising custom exceptions using `raise`

---

## ✅ What I Practiced
- Preventing crashes caused by invalid input  
- Handling common errors like `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`  
- Creating functions that raise meaningful custom errors  
- Safely writing to files with `finally`

---

## ✅ Why This Matters for AI
Error handling becomes critical when:
- Loading data  
- Training models  
- Working with files, APIs, or long-running scripts  
- Debugging unexpected model outputs  

Good error handling makes AI code stable and professional.

## 🧠 Takeaway
Error handling gives me control over unexpected situations.  
Instead of crashing, my program responds gracefully.  
This is essential for becoming a strong AI engineer.
