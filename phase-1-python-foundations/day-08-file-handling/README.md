# Day 8 – File Handling

Today I learned how Python reads and writes files using `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and context managers.

## ✅ What I learned
- Opening files in different modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)
- Reading a file's contents
- Writing text into a file
- Appending new content to an existing file
- Using `with open()` to safely manage files

## ✅ What I practiced
- Creating a new text file
- Writing multiple lines
- Reading the file back
- Appending new lines

## ✅ Takeaway
File handling feels like giving my programs the ability to “remember.”  
This is the foundation for logging, saving data, and building real applications.
