# Day 1 – Python Basics

Today I began my AI Engineering journey by learning Python fundamentals.  
I focused on variables, data types, and simple operations.

## ✅ What I learned
- What variables are
- How Python stores data (ints, floats, strings, booleans)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Basic string operations (concatenation and repetition)

## ✅ What I practiced
- Creating different types of variables
- Checking variable types using `type()`
- Simple math operations
- Combining strings

## ✅ Takeaway
Small, consistent steps matter — especially while balancing learning with being a new mom.
