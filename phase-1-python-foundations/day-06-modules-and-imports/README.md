# Day 6 – Modules and Imports

Today I learned how Python organizes code into modules and how importing works.  
This helps keep programs clean, reusable, and easier to manage.

## ✅ What I learned
- What Python modules are  
- How to import built-in modules  
- How to create and import my own module  
- Why modular code is easier to maintain  

## ✅ What I practiced
- Using the `math` module  
- Importing specific functions  
- Creating a separate `.py` file and importing it  
- Organizing code across multiple files  

## ✅ Takeaway
Understanding imports feels like unlocking a new level of structure.  
It’s the foundation for using AI libraries like NumPy and PyTorch later.
