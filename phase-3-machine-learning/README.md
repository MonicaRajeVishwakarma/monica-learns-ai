# Phase 3 – Machine Learning

This phase introduces supervised ML: regression, classification, and model evaluation.
By the end of this phase, you will build a complete ML project:
**AI-Powered New Mom Sleep Pattern Recommender.**

## Days Breakdown
- **Day 13 – Machine Learning Fundamentals**
- **Day 14 – Regression Models**
- **Day 15 – Classification Models**
- **Day 16 – Evaluation Metrics**
- **Day 17 – First ML Project**

This phase bridges the gap between data handling (Phase 2) and real AI engineering (Phase 4: Deep Learning).
